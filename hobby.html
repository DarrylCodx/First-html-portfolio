    <h1><i>Hobbies & Interests</i></h1>
    <p>
        Outside of my academic and professional work, I’m passionate about <br>
        exploring the connections between technology, business, and human behavior. <br> 
        I enjoy diving into data-driven projects, experimenting with digital tools, <br>
        and keeping up with trends in IT, finance, and innovation. <br>
        To keep a healthy balance, I regularly engage in sports and fitness <br>
        not only for physical well-being but also to stay focused and mentally sharp. <br>
        In my downtime, I enjoy reading about personal growth, leadership, and productivity. <br>
        I also have a creative side: photography and digital media editing allow me to express ideas <br>
        visually and think from different perspectives.These hobbies help me stay curious, adaptable, <br>
        and motivated both in my personal life and professional journey.Let me know if you'd like it shorter,<br>
        more casual, or tailored to a specific style of website (e.g., minimalist, tech portfolio, blog-style). </p>

        <h2>Beyond Work: What Drives Me</h2>
        <P>
            Outside my academic and professional focus, I actively cultivate interests that reflect my curiosity, <br>
            discipline, and creativity qualities I bring into every project I take on. I’m passionate <br>
            about data-driven thinking and enjoy applying analytical tools to real-world challenges, often <br>
            experimenting with small side projects to deepen my technical and strategic skills. <br>
            I regularly follow trends in digital innovation, business technology, and IT strategy to stay <br> 
            ahead in a fast-evolving landscape.To balance this, I invest time in fitness and sports, <br>
            which help me stay resilient and focused both mentally and physically. I’m also drawn to creative <br>
            work like photography and digital editing, which sharpen my eye for detail and foster a design-oriented mindset. <br>
            These interests not only keep me engaged and balanced, but also strengthen the interdisciplinary approach <br>
            I bring to business informatics: analytical, structured, and open to fresh perspectives.
